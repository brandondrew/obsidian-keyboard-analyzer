This plugin will allow you to see and analyze all your assigned hotkeys to
commands in Obsidian.

The plugin is poorly tested on operating systems other than Windows, I would be
grateful for any help with this plugin.

P.S. This is my first public code in my life - would be happy to get feedback or
a donation to continue writing plugins for obsidian.
