This plugin will allow you will be able to:

- see and analyze all your assigned hotkeys in Obsidian on visual keyboard
  layout
- search by key combination
- see custom hotkeys
- see duplicate hotkeys
- highlight featured hotkeys

The plugin is poorly tested on operating systems other than Windows, I would be
grateful for any help with this plugin.

P.S. This is my first public code in my life - would be happy to get feedback or
a donation which will help me to continue creating this and other plugins for
obsidian.
